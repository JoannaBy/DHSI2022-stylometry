# DHSI Stylometry with R: Computer-Assisted Analysis of Literary Texts
Notes and materials for "Stylometry with R: Computer-Assisted Analysis of Literary Texts" course run by [Maciej Eder](http://maciejeder.org/), [Joanna Byszuk](https://joannaby.github.io/) and [Artjoms Šeļa](https://computationalstylistics.github.io/people/09_Artjoms_Sela/) at the [DHSI 2022](http://www.dhsi.org).  
  
We acknowledge and respect the Lkwungen-speaking peoples, on whose traditional territory the university where we teach stands, and the Songhees, Esquimalt and WSÁNEĆ peoples whose historical relationships with the land continue to this day.  

## Pre-course
Before the course, please take a look at the reading list and install necessary programs. Please take a moment to read [DHSI Statement on Ethics and Inclusion](https://dhsi.org/statement-of-ethics-inclusion/).
  
### Reading  
All the suggested readings are available in the coursepack provided to you via DHSI channels.  
We also created a [syllabus of references used in the coursepack and suggested further reading](https://github.com/JoannaBy/DHSI2022-Stylometry/blob/main/before_the_course/reading.md) (note that the latter list might grow to reflect our discussions during the course).
  
### Installations
You will find detailed installation tips [here](https://github.com/JoannaBy/DHSI2022-Stylometry/blob/master/before_the_course/installations.md)

### Useful links and homework
While you are not obliged to do this before the course, you might find it useful to take a look [here](https://github.com/JoannaBy/DHSI2022-Stylometry/blob/main/before_the_course/useful_tools.md) and think about your text editor and other tools you use. Finally, take a look at [the homeworks](https://github.com/JoannaBy/DHSI2022-Stylometry/blob/main/before_the_course/homeworks.md) we will be dealing with - perhaps you'd like to get a head start and have more time to relax in the evenings during the course?

## During the course
The following files will be changing to best reflect the interest of the group (and to document what we do together). The proposed schedule is a very rough version based on our past experiences teaching this course.
