# Homeworks
## For the first day
Install necessary [programs](https://github.com/JoannaBy/DHSI2022-Stylometry/blob/main/installations.md), let us know if you encounter problems that you cannot fix - you will find the list of common issues [here](https://github.com/computationalstylistics/stylo#installation-issues). 

## For the second and fourth day
Prepare your corpus: 
* about 20-30 texts of approximately similar length (while you can use more, we advise you stay below 100, please bear in mind that we will do computations locally on your computers and large datasets take more time to process and can be more difficult to analyze), 
* saved in plain text (txt) format, UTF-8 encoded (if you're using Windows machine, please check that the files are saved as UTF-8 without BOM - you can easily do that with one of the text editors we recommended in [useful tools](https://github.com/JoannaBy/DHSI2022-Stylometry/blob/main/before_the_course/useful_tools.md).  
* the topic / genre / time of creation all influence the style to various extent, so try to make your selection of texts taking this into consideration, e.g. for starters choose (literary) texts that don't completely differ in genre and topic, and were created in the same period.  
  
One source of texts you may want to choose is [Project Gutenberg](http://www.gutenberg.org/). You can also choose of the corpora offered in our group's [resources](https://computationalstylistics.github.io/resources/).

## For the second and third day
Think about an authorship case study you'd like to do tomorrow. We'll be learning classify() and rolling.classify(), which are methods for examining influences on the author in detail. While we'll be able to provide you with data for experiments, you now know it's even more fun if you do your own thing.  
You will need:  
* 1 (or more) text you want to examine. It can be an anonymous work or a suspected collaborative work,
* collection of texts by at least 2 potential authors,
  * note that the number of words for each of them should be roughly equal, so e.g. 5 texts of 10,000 words each for each of the authors is fine, but 5 of 10,000 and 10 of 100 - not.
